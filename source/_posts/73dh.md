# 关于博客评论更换的通知

亲爱的访问者们：

  你们好！
  2024年9月2日下午，Deta Space发出声明，Deta Space将于2024年10月17日的日落时分关闭，下面是具体的信息：

```txt
Dear Deta Community,

After an incredible run, we've made the difficult decision to shut down Deta Space. You can continue to login until sunset on October 17, 2024, at which point we will start deleting all Horizons, apps (hosted or installed) and data in Collections.

We've built tools for exporting your data (and code for developers), with tutorials available in the docs.

We wanted to thank you for joining the journey so far. Everything we've done wouldn't have been possible without our community, mods, investors, and friends. We hope you'll stick around for what's next.

What's next for Deta?
The team is working on what we think is our most exciting product yet: Deta Surf. We can't wait to onboard people in the very near future. If you were a fan of Deta's past products, we'd love if you popped by.

Why are we sunsetting Space?
As a team, we want computing on the web to be more personal, powerful and fun. Space (& our earlier products) were built in this vein. But they didn't really hit enough for us to continue. We're a startup and at some point, we have to move on from good (& bad) products in search of really great ones.

We're still searching, and the team is working on Deta Surf. We've been pretty quiet about it, but it takes learnings from everything we've built. We'd love if you checked it out.

What about my account?
You can export all your code and data. You can decide if you want to delete your account entirely or be kept in the loop about Deta Surf .

How long will the service be available?
The service will be available until October 17, 2024. After that, all Horizons, apps (hosted or installed) and data in Collections will be deleted.
```

  由于本人的 Waline 评论系统部署在 Deta Space，所以从2024.9.12开始，本人开始通过Netlify和MongoDB搭建Twikoo评论系统。本人同样尝试过使用Vercel、Netlify+Leancloud搭建Waline评论系统，评论系统搭建成功，但是导入数据时发生了错误：

```command
500: Class or object doesn't exists. [404 GET https://*********.api.lncldglobal.com/1.1/classes/Counter]
```

  故此博客将从Waline改为Twikoo为主要系统，对于之前的评论数据，我们别无选择。
  对此，请所有人于2024.10.17日前转至Twikoo评论系统，10.17日后将更换全新数据库！
